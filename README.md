#Fbook AutoWish

###Automatically wishes happy birthday to friends.

Yeah - I'm too lazy to remember to visit fbook dailyâ€¦AND I think wishing old acquaintances happy birthday is a nice thing to do. This takes care of that problem.  Oh yeah, and thanks to @jonallured - I also added a googled birthday image to the fbook message for good measure.
